# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Project

## 📖 Overview
This project presents a professional exploratory data analysis (EDA) of historical weather data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The objective is to clean the dataset, analyze key weather parameters, and visualize trends to extract meaningful insights. 

This repository is structured and documented to meet academic, portfolio, and entry-level data analyst project standards.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow
### 1. Data Loading 
- Importing the dataset using Pandas

- Performed an initial review of shape, columns,and data types

### 2. Data Quality Check 
- Checked missing values using isnull()

- Identified numerical and categorical columns separately

### 3. Data Cleaning 
- Numerical columns were imputed using mean values

- Categorical columns were imputed using mode values

- Verified that all missing values were successfully handled

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

Tempreture Analysis
- Analyzed temperature variations using afternoon (3 PM) temperature data

- Observed fluctuations indicating changing weather condicating changing weather conditions over time

- Temprature trend helps in understanding seasonal and daily weather patterns

Rainfall Analysis
- Histogram used to visualize rainfall distribution

- Majority of observations show low rainfall values

- Heavy rainfall events are relatively infrequent

Wind Speed Analysis
- Compared wind speed at 9am and 3pm

- Afternoon wind speed show greater variability

- Visualized using frequency distribution plots

## 📊 Key Insights
- Weather conditions are mostly stable across the dataset

- Rainfall data is tight-skewed with fewer extreme values

- Wind speed tends to increase and vary more in the afternoon

## 📉 Visualizations
All plots generated during the analysis are saved in the images/ folder and referenced for insights.

## ✅ Conclusion 
This project demonstrates a structured and professional approach to weather data analysis. It highlights practical skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analytical interpretation, making it suitable for:

- Academic submission

- GitHub portfolio

- Entry-level data analytics interviews
